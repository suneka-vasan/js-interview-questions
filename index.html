    <strong>JAVASCRIPT INTERVIEW QUESTIONS</strong>
</div>
<div class="container">
<h4 class="text-primary">1. What is JavaScript?</h4>
<p>JavaScript is a lightweight, interpreted programming language with object-oriented capabilities that allows you to build
interactivity into otherwise static HTML pages. It can be used for both server-side, as well as client-side scripting and the good thing is it is known to provide the
best results in every aspect. When it comes to building HTML WebPages, this language is often considered and is known to
bring the most desired outcomes.</p>
<h4 class="text-primary">2. Is JavaScript a case-sensitive language?</h4>
<p>Yes, JavaScript is a case sensitive language. The language keywords, variables, function names, and any other
identifiers must always be typed with a consistent capitalization of letters.</p>
<h4 class="text-primary">3. Differences between declaring variables using var, let and const.</h4>
<table class="table table-bordered w-50">
    <tbody>
        <tr>
        <th>keyword</th>
        <th>const</th>
        <th>let</th>
        <th>var</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>global scope</td>
            <td>no</td>
            <td>no</td>
            <td>yes</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>function scope</td>
            <td>yes</td>
            <td>yes</td>
            <td>yes</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>block scope</td>
            <td>yes</td>
            <td>yes</td>
            <td>no</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>can be reassigned</td>
            <td>no</td>
            <td>yes</td>
            <td>yes</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>

<h4 class="text-primary">4. How many data types are there in JavaScript? Can you name them?</h4>
<p>There are 6 data types in JavaScript and they are:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Function</li>
    <li>String</li>
    <li>Undefined</li>
    <li>Number</li>
    <li>Boolean</li>
    <li>Object</li>
</ul>
<h4 class="text-primary">5. Difference between “ == “ and “ === “ operators.</h4>
<p>Both are comparison operators. The difference between both the operators is that “==” is used to compare values whereas,
“ === “ is used to compare both values and types.</p>
<pre><code class="language-js hljs language-xml"><script>var x = 2;
var y = "2";
(x == y)  // Returns true since the value of both x and y is the same
(x === y) // Returns false since the typeof x is "number" and typeof y is "string"
</script>
</code></pre>
<h4 class="text-primary">6. What is the difference between Attributes and Property?</h4>
<p><strong>Attributes-</strong> provide more details on an element like id, type, value etc.</p>

<p><strong>Property-</strong> is the value assigned to the property like type=”text”, value=’Name’ etc.</p>
<h4 class="text-primary">7. List out the different ways an HTML element can be accessed in a JavaScript code.</h4>
<p><strong>getElementById(‘idname’):</strong> Gets an element by its ID name<br>
<strong>getElementsByClass(‘classname’):</strong> Gets all the elements that have the given classname.<br>
<strong>getElementsByTagName(‘tagname’):</strong> Gets all the elements that have the given tag name.<br>
<strong>querySelector():</strong> This function takes css style selector and returns the first selected element.</p>
<h4 class="text-primary">8. In how many ways a JavaScript code can be involved in an HTML file?</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Inline</li>
    <li>Internal</li>
    <li>External</li>
</ul>
<h4 class="text-primary">9. What is the difference between null & undefined?</h4>
<p>Undefined means a variable has been declared but has not yet been assigned a value. On the other hand, null is an
assignment value. It can be assigned to a variable as a representation of no value. Also, undefined and null are two
distinct types: undefined is a type itself (undefined) while null is an object.</p>
<h4 class="text-primary">10. Explain strict mode and how can it be enabled??</h4>
<p>Eliminates some JavaScript silent errors by changing them to throw errors.<br>
Fixes mistakes that make it difficult for JavaScript engines to perform optimizations: strict mode code can sometimes be
made to run faster than identical code that's not strict mode.<br>
When you use strict mode, you cannot use implicitly declared variables, or assign a value to a read-only property, or
add a property to an object that is not extensible.<br>
You can enable strict mode by adding “use strict” at the beginning of a file, a program, or a function.
</p>
<h4 class="text-primary">11. What are arrow functions and what advantages are using it?</h4>
<p>Arrow functions were introduced in the ES6 version of javascript. They provide us with a new and shorter syntax for
declaring functions. Arrow functions can only be used as a function expression.</p>
<pre><code class="language-js hljs language-xml"><script>// Traditional Function Expression
var add = function (a, b) {
    return a + b;
}

// Arrow Function Expression
var arrowAdd = (a, b) => a + b;</script>
</code></pre>
<p>Arrow functions are declared without the function keyword. If there is only one returning expression then we don’t need
to use the return keyword as well as in an arrow function. Also, for functions having just
one line of code, curly braces { } can be omitted.</p>
<h4 class="text-primary">12. What are callbacks? Why do we use callbacks?</h4>
<p>A callback is a function that will be executed after another function gets executed. In javascript, functions are
treated as first-class citizens, they can be used as an argument of another function, can be returned by another
function, and can be used as a property of an object.<br>
A callback function is a method that is sent as an input to another function (now let us name this other function
"thisFunction"), and it is performed inside the thisFunction after the function has completed execution.</p>
<h4 class="text-primary">13. What is Object Destructuring?</h4>
<p>Object destructuring is a new way to extract elements from an object or an array.</p>
<pre><code class="language-js hljs language-xml"><script>// Variable assignment.
const foo = ['one', 'two', 'three'];

const [one, two, three] = foo;
console.log(one); // "one"
console.log(two); // "two"
console.log(three); // "three"
</script>
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-js hljs language-xml"><script>// Variable assignment.
const o = { p: 42, q: true };
const { p, q } = o;

console.log(p); // 42
console.log(q); // true
</script>
</code></pre>
<h4 class="text-primary">14. Explain what is Hoisting in Javascript?</h4>
<p>Hoisting is the default behaviour of javascript where all the variable and function declarations are moved on top.</p>
<h4 class="text-primary">15. How does TypeOf Operator work?</h4>
<p>JavaScript provides a typeof operator that can examine a value and tell you what type it is:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js hljs language-xml"><script>var a;
typeof a;				// "undefined"

a = "hello world";
typeof a;				// "string"

a = 42;
typeof a;				// "number"

a = true;
typeof a;				// "boolean"

a = null;
typeof a;				// "object" -- weird, bug

a = undefined;
typeof a;				// "undefined"

a = { b: "c" };
typeof a;				// "object"
</script>
</code></pre>
